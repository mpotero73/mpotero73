- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpotero73
- 👀 I’m interested in developing small coding source codes and evetually creating some rudimentary games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# programming language and developing small programs with Visual Studios.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating simple source codes from complex codes to make it easier to write the codes. 
- 📫 How to reach me just hit me up on the Github page as I am new and never had a github account before.
